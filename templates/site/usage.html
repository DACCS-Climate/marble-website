                <p>Marble provides an all-in-one data catalog and development environment hosted by U of T or another
                    member of the Marble network.  Using web processing services tailored for climate analyses,
                    specific information can be extracted from any dataset on Marble’s STAC catalog.</p>

                <p>Data stored on the Marble network can be accessed by all users, no matter where it’s hosted.
                    Results from processing data can be stored in the JupyterLab development environment.  No need to
                    ensure your laptop has enough storage or computing power.

            <p>A large part of being a researcher is getting published.  Long hours of analyzing data, creating and
                modifying workflows, and collaborating with other researchers are the norm.</p>

            <p>Marble makes the process easier by hosting the analytical software and the data. Using a familiar
                JupyterLab development environment, researchers can access web processing services that implement
                OGCAPI, the key part of "moving the application to the data".  The Weaver web processing service
                allows workflows to be created that can chain other web processing services, such as Finch and Raven,
                and execute them on the Marble platform where the data is already stored.
            </p>
            <p>Marble provides avenues for sharing and collaboration.  Workflows and results created on Marble or uploaded to the platform can be made
                public to others on the network and be easily discoverable by like-minded colleagues.</p>
