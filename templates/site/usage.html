                <p>Marble provides an all-in-one data catalog and development environment hosted by U of T or another
                    member of the Marble network.  Data stored on the Marble network can be accessed by all users, no
                    matter where it is hosted.  Using web processing services tailored for climate analysis, Marble
                    is great for those getting started in climate research. </p>

                <p>Marble uses JupyterLab as its development environment.  JupyterLab lets you create self-contained
                    notebooks that can access datasets stored on Marble's STAC catalog, and conduct data analysis using tools such as
                    data science oriented Python packages.</p>

                <p>All data storage and data processing are done on the Marble platform.  No need to
                    ensure your laptop has enough storage or computing power.</p>

            <p>A large part of being a researcher is getting published.  Long hours of analyzing data, creating and
                modifying workflows, and collaborating with other researchers are the norm.</p>

            <p>Marble makes the process easier by hosting the analytical software and the data. Using a familiar
                JupyterLab development environment, researchers can access web processing services that implement
                OGCAPI, the key part of "moving the application to the data".  The Weaver web processing service
                allows workflows to be created that can chain other web processing services, such as Finch and Raven,
                and execute them on the Marble platform where the data is already stored.
            </p>
            <p>Marble provides avenues for sharing and collaboration.  Workflows and results created on Marble, or
                uploaded to the platform, can be made public to others on the network and be easily discoverable by
                like-minded colleagues.</p>
