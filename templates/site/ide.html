            <p>
                The Marble platform uses JupyterHub as its IDE. Its browser-based interface offers an intuitive and accessible platform for users, making it incredibly user-friendly.
                    One of its most significant advantages lies in its ability to give users access to computational environments and resources without burdening the users with installation and maintenance tasks.
                JupyterHub empowers individuals and teams by streamlining the process of setting up and managing computational environments,
                allowing them to focus their energy and time on actual coding, data analysis, and research, thereby enhancing productivity and collaboration.
