            <p>Marble is a network of cloud based web services <a class='paragraph-href' href='node.html'>nodes</a>
            that provide access to large climate and satellite data sets.
            Marble offers cloud-based data analytics that implements
            <a class='paragraph-href' href='https://www.ogc.org/'>Open Geoscience Consortium (OGC)</a> standards for
            finding and interacting with data, and an online
            <a class='paragraph-href' href='https://jupyter.org/'>workspace</a>
            that includes climate data analytics tools.</p>

        <p>The key principle is to bring the computation to where the data is, rather than vice versa. The platform
        strives to serve the diverse needs of climate researchers, non-profits, government agencies at all levels,
        civic minded individuals, educators and journalists, enabling them to study and communicate the impacts of
        climate change without worrying about the technical logistics.Marble is the bridge between intricate climate
        data and the people who seek to understand it, fostering a community of inquiry and discovery in the realm of
        climate science.</p>" %}
