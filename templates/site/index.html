                Marble is a network of cloud based web services nodes that provide access to large climate and satellite
                data sets.
                Marble offers cloud-based data analytics that implements <a href="https://www.ogc.org/" target="_blank">Open Geoscience Consortium (OGC)</a> standards for
                finding and interacting with data, and an online workspace that includes climate data analytics tools.
            </p>

            <p>
                The key principle is to bring the computation to where the data is, rather than vice versa. The platform strives to
                serve the diverse needs of climate researchers, non-profits, government agencies at all levels, civic minded
                individuals, educators and journalists, enabling them to study and communicate the impacts of climate change
                without worrying about the technical logistics.
